  <p>
    This is an assignment being done for
    <b>Engineering Software & Application</b> module.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project focuses on developing a simulation tool for a Lotion
    Manufacturing Industry using LabView. This tool emulates the operational
    flows of a factory, providing a virtual representation of the manufacturing
    process.
  </p>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>• GUI with input selections on manufacturing</li>
    <li>• Process simulations</li>
    <li>• Event logging</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The simulation replicates the lotion manufacturing process, providing
    insights into operational aspects. It serves as an educational tool for
    understanding chemical manufacturing and offers a platform for further
    development and customization.
