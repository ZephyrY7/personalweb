    This project aims to revolutionize electrical pre-installation inspections
    by replacing traditional manual methods with smart glasses integrated with
    an LLM chatbot. This innovative approach addresses issues such as time
    consumption, human error, and inefficiency associated with manual
    inspections.

  <p>
    Key objectives of this project include integrating a chatbot for seamless
    communication, developing a system for remote access to data by
    electricians, and evaluating the impact on efficiency. Technologies like
    retrieval augmentation generation are utilized for remote data collection,
    eliminating the need for electricians' physical presence on-site. The
    project's outcomes include enhanced efficiency and accuracy in electrical
    pre-installation projects, improved client communication and satisfaction,
    and the ability for electricians to plan projects remotely, optimizing
    timelines and reducing errors.
