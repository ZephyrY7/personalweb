  <p>
    This is an assignment being done for
    <b>Digital Signal Processing</b> module.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project focuses on developing a Speech Enhancement System using MATLAB
    to improve speech signal quality by reducing noise interference. It
    addresses challenges posed by both external and internal noises that often
    degrade communication quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary outcome is the significant enhancement of speech quality, with
    reduced noise interference.
  </p>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>• Noise classification input</li>
    <li>
      • Different filter types (Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, and Kaiser
      Window)
    </li>
    <li>• Graphical output representation</li>
  </ul>
