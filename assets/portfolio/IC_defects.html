    This is an assignment being done for
    <b>Machine Vision Intelligence</b> module.

  <p>
    This project is using OpenCV for detecting scratches on integrated circuit
    (IC) surfaces, emphasizing accurate labeling and the advantages of automated
    inspection over human visual inspection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, the use of the YOLOv5 model for object detection, dataset
    generation, and AI training are used to improve the detection. The project
    details the process of extracting images from videos, annotating regions of
    interest, and training the AI model on Google Colab.
