  <p>This is a project being done for <b>APICTA 2022</b>.</p>

  <p>
    The Carbon Sensing Drone is a pioneering solution designed to automate the
    measurement of carbon emission levels across geographical areas. Equipped
    with advanced sensors and technology, this drone offers efficient data
    collection for environmental research and management. Its key features
    include autonomous measurement capabilities, planned route optimization
    through a mission planner software, and real-time data collection for
    monitoring environmental changes.
