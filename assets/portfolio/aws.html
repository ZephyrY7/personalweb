    A website deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS), creating a secure,
    scalable, and efficient platform for managing global development statistics.
    Leveraging AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, and auto-scaling, the website
    ensures high availability and performance. Collaboration tools like GitHub
    and Microsoft Teams were used for efficient development.
