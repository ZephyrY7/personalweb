  <h2 class="popup-title">Smart Parking System</h2>
  <hr class="popup-title-line" />

  <p>This is an assignment being done for <b>VLSI Design</b> module.</p>

  <p>
    This project focuses on developing a sophisticated Digital Car Parking
    System using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). This innovative
    system aims to alleviate the perennial issues faced by drivers in densely
    populated urban areas, where finding a suitable parking spot can be a
    time-consuming and frustrating experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the primary goals of the Digital Car Parking System is to
    significantly reduce the time and effort drivers expend in searching for
    parking spaces. Enhanced security measures, such as password authentication,
    ensure the safety of parked vehicles. The system's ability to display
    real-time parking space availability at the entrance of parking lots can
    help prevent overcrowding and improve the overall efficiency of parking
    operations.

  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>• Real-time Monitoring</li>
    <li>• Automated Entry and Exit</li>
    <li>• Smart Allocation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The core of the system is built using VHDL, a versatile hardware description
    language commonly used in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) programming.
    Various sensing technologies, including IR sensors and laser detection, are
    integrated into the system to ensure accurate and reliable monitoring of
    parking spaces. The system features a user-friendly interface that allows
    drivers to interact with the system, including setting up a secure code for
    vehicle retrieval.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its implementation not only enhances the convenience and safety of parking
    but also aligns with the broader objectives of smart city development.
