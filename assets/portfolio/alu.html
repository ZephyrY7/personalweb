  <p>
    Design and simulation of an ALU, a critical component of a CPU responsible
    for arithmetic and logic operations in computers.

  <p>
    The ALU is designed to perform arithmetic operations like addition and
    subtraction, as well as logic operations such as XOR, OR, AND, and NOT. Dual
    Unit Design: The ALU is divided into the Arithmetic Unit (AU) and the Logic
    Unit (LU), each dedicated to specific types of operations. Output
    Representation: The project utilizes Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to represent
    the output, displayed using seven-segment displays.

  <p>
    Each group member contributed to different components of the ALU, which were
    later integrated into a cohesive unit. Logical Design Process: The design
    involved creating truth tables, Karnaugh maps, and Boolean expressions to
    simplify logic gates required for the ALU.

    This ALU design project showcases practical application of digital
    electronics principles, highlighting the students' systematic approach and
    successful outcomes achieved through collaboration and rigorous design
    processes.
