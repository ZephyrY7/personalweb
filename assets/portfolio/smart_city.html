    The project described in this paper focuses on the development of a Smart
    City system, integrating advanced technology to enhance urban living. Key
    features include a Smart Traffic Light System, Autonomous Solar Tracking
    System, Smart Waste Management System, and Smart Street Lighting System.
    Implemented using an Arduino MCU and programmed in C, the project aims to
    create a more efficient, sustainable, and convenient urban environment,
    aligning with the broader goals of smart cities.
